LibTracker::Client version 0.01
===============================

Tracker is a tool designed to extract information and metadata about your
personal data so that it can be searched easily and quickly.

By using Tracker, you no longer have to remember where you've left your
files. To locate a file you only need to remember something about it, such
as a word in the document or the artist of the song. This is because as well
as searching for files in the traditional way, by name and location, Tracker
searches files' contents and metadata.

Tracker is available from http://www.gnome.org/projects/tracker/

libtrackerclient is the Tracker client library. This module implements the
Perl interface to libtrackerclient.
