Tasks remaining :

  * Add the tracker_search_get_hit_count_all() method : I've never seen this
    used. A websearch yields no results. A Google code search turns up only
    the tracker header and sources.

  * Add the tracker_search_text_detailed() method : A little bit later.

  * Implement tests for untested stuff (text search).

  * Implement tracker_search_query : for RDF queries. Not too high on my
    priority list.

  * Licensing : Tracker is LGPL. Perl is GPL/Artistic.
